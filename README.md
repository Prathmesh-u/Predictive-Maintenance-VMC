# Predictive Maintenance for VMC Machines (Industry 4.0 Application)

This is a real-world, data-driven application I built after working with actual shop-floor data from a VMC (Vertical Machining Center) and bending machine in an Industry 4.0-enabled manufacturing setup.

The goal was to:
- **Analyze machine behavior**
- **Detect early signs of tool failure**
- **Improve part quality**
- **Minimize downtime**


## Project Overview

✅ This project takes in key machine parameters like:
- Spindle speed
- Feed rate
- Tool wear
- Vibration level
- Spindle temperature
- Power consumption

Using **threshold-based logic and parameter relationships**, it predicts:

- **Part Status** (OK / Faulty)
- **Machine Status** (Running / Warning / Fail)
- **Likely Defect Type** (Wear, Misalignment, Heat Stress, etc.)

It also logs every evaluation for traceability, and includes a batch mode for uploading multiple records at once.

## How It Works (Rule-based ML-like Logic) 🧠

Instead of relying on traditional ML models trained on synthetic data (which was inconsistent), I built a **smart rule-based engine** using actual domain knowledge and industry insights.

### Logic Behind the Predictions:
Each input parameter is evaluated against a well-defined operational range:
- If **any one parameter exceeds its threshold**, it triggers a warning or part failure.
- Certain combinations of high vibration, temperature, and tool wear lead to **specific defect types**.

The app dynamically shows:
- **Prediction status**
- **Confidence levels**
- **Triggering parameters**
- **Likely defect causes**

This makes the system explainable and ready for industrial use where decisions must be backed by logic.


## Features ⚙️

-  **Manual Mode** with sliders for real-time testing
-  **Batch Mode** via CSV file upload
-  **Evaluation Log** stored locally for future audit
-  **Professional UI** with metrics and defect diagnosis
-  **Explainable outputs** (no black-box ML here)
-  Built in **Python + Streamlit**, deployable on any platform


## Tech Stack 📁

- Python 3.11+
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Joblib
- VS Code for development
- GitHub + Streamlit Cloud for deployment


## Real-World Application

This project is based on real industrial data from a plant I visited. I personally collected, cleaned, and analyzed over 3,000 entries from VMC and bending machine logs.

It was also used to:
- Design insightful Power BI dashboards
- Understand root causes behind part rejections
- Guide predictive maintenance practices
